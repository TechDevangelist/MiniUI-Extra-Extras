### _Extra Retroarch cores for MiniUI on the Miyoo Mini_ ###
Utilizing the very convenient modularity of MiniUI's structure, we can add a lot of RetroArch cores that already work in Onion!
This initial batch is really only the cores I made for myself based on the systems I wanted to play. Additional cores may be provided upon request (or PR). 

Cores are provided AS-IS as I am not the one who compiled them and I will likely not be making any changes to cores in order to get things working. DO REMEMBER to not pester shauninman, the creator of MiniUI, about any of these cores as they are provided unofficially. 

## Installation
- Download the latest release and extract the contents of the zip file to the root of your MiniUI SD card
- Transfer your ROM files into the appropriate folders (don't forget BIOS files for the cores that need them!)
- Eject your SD, insert it into your Miyoo Mini and enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes
### General
- If colors are distorted when first launching a ROM, try changing the display filter or scaling.
### Final Burn Alpha
- Large NeoGeo ROMs take _awhile_ to load, so if you see a black screen, just give it a minute. 
  - Save states will not bypass the time it takes to initially load the ROM.
- You can create additional ROM folders to separate some Arcade systems. For example, you could make a folder titled "NeoGeo (FBA)" and put all of your NeoGeo ROMs there to have a dedicated entry. DO NOTE that this method will make all folders that share the "FBA" core share settings.
- Adding the NeoGeo unibios to your `neogeo.zip` is _highly_ reocommended as it adds the ability to switch between AES/MVS modes and region on boot and adds cheats for some games (accessible by pressing SELECT + R1 by default). 
### Doom
- The Doom core is compatible with PRBoom compatible mods. Loading multiple files may be possible in the future, I just haven't figured out _how_ just yet.
  - DO NOT hit "Quit" from within the Doom main menu! This will crash Picoarch and you will have to force restart your system by holding MENU and POWER!
- Mods that I have confirmed working: SCYTHE, BTSX_E1, FreeDoom (Episode 1)
- Rumble works and (I think) is enabled by default
### WonderSwan & NeoGeo Pocket Color
- If you want separate folders for each system version, you can create them under ROMs; just be sure to include the same TAG that is in parenthesis. Example: "NeoGeo Pocket (NGP)"
